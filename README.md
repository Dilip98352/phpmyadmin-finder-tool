## ‚ú® Features

- Intuitive GUI: A clean and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
- Multi-Threaded Scanning: Ensures the UI remains responsive and never freezes, even during intensive scans.
- Comprehensive Path List: Checks over 40 common and obscure paths where phpMyAdmin might be hosted.
- Subdomain Scanning: Optionally scans a list of common subdomains (e.g., `db`, `mysql`, `phpmyadmin`) to find hidden panels.
- Flexible Port Scanning: Scans popular web ports, including `80`, `443`, `8080`, `2083`, and `10000`.
- Smart Detection Engine:
  - Keyword Matching: Analyzes page titles and content for phpMyAdmin-specific keywords.
  - Favicon Hash Matching: Identifies panels by comparing favicon hashes against known phpMyAdmin icons.
  - `robots.txt` Analysis: Parses `robots.txt` for `Disallow` entries that may reveal panel locations.
- Live-Updating Log Panel: Provides real-time, color-coded feedback on the scanning process.
- Easy Scan Cancellation: Stop any ongoing scan instantly with a single click.
- Custom User-Agent: Set a custom User-Agent string for all HTTP requests.
