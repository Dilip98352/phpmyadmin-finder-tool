![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

A graphical, multi-threaded scanner written in Python and Tkinter to discover hidden or non-standard phpMyAdmin login panels on web servers. This tool uses a combination of techniques for a comprehensive and efficient search.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface: Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.
- Multi-Threaded Scanning: Keeps UI responsive while scanning runs in the background.
- Comprehensive Path List: Checks over 40 common and obscure phpMyAdmin paths.
- Subdomain Scanning: Option to scan popular subdomains like `db.example.com` or `mysql.example.com`.
- Port Scanning: Scans multiple common web ports: 80, 443, 8080, 2083, 10000.
- Smart Detection:
  - Content and Title analysis for phpMyAdmin keywords.
  - Favicon `favicon.ico` hash checking against known phpMyAdmin hashes.
  - Robots.txt analysis for `Disallow` entries indicating panel locations.
- Real-time Logging: Colored log output updates in real time.
- Cancellable Scans: Stop the scan anytime via UI.
- Custom User-Agent: Specify a custom User-Agent string for HTTP requests.
