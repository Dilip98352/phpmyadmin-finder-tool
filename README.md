‚ú® Features

Intuitive GUI: A clean and user-friendly interface powered by Tkinter.

Responsive Multi-Threaded Scanning: Ensures the UI remains responsive and never freezes, even during intensive scans.

Comprehensive Path List: Checks over 40 common and obscure paths where phpMyAdmin might be hosted.

Subdomain Scanning: Optionally scans a list of common subdomains (e.g., db., mysql., phpmyadmin.) to find hidden panels.

Flexible Port Scanning: Scans common web ports, including 80, 443, 8080, 2083, and 10000.

Smart Detection Engine:

Keyword Matching: Analyzes page titles and content for phpMyAdmin-specific keywords.

Favicon Hash Matching: Identifies panels by comparing the target's favicon hash against known phpMyAdmin icons.

robots.txt Analysis: Parses robots.txt files for Disallow entries that may reveal panel locations.

Live-Updating Log Panel: Provides real-time, color-coded feedback on the scanning process.

Easy Scan Cancellation: Stop any ongoing scan instantly with a single click.

Custom User-Agent: Allows you to set a custom User-Agent string for all HTTP requests.
